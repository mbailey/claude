# Task Commands Configuration

Shared context and conventions for all task commands.

## File Locations

- **Task breakdowns**: `docs/tasks/breakdowns/TASK_NAME.md`
- **Implementation plans**: `docs/tasks/plans/PLAN_NAME.md`
- **Task templates**: `docs/tasks/templates/TEMPLATE_NAME.md`
- **Progress tracking**: `docs/tasks/tracking/PROJECT_NAME.md`

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all filenames
- Include date prefix for time-sensitive items: `2024-06-10-user-auth-breakdown.md`
- Use descriptive names that indicate scope: `user-dashboard-refactor`, `payment-integration-plan`

## Standard Metadata

All task documents should include minimal frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: "breakdown|plan|template|tracking"
project: "project-name"
created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
status: "draft|active|completed"
priority: "high|medium|low"
---
```

## Task Formatting Standards

- Use hierarchical markdown lists for breakdowns
- Include priority indicators: ðŸ”´ High, ðŸŸ¡ Medium, ðŸŸ¢ Low
- Add effort estimates in parentheses: `(2h)`, `(1d)`, `(1w)`
- Use checkboxes for trackable items: `- [ ] Task description`

## Integration Patterns

- Link to related specs in `docs/specs/`
- Reference git branches and PRs where applicable
- Include test criteria and validation steps
- Connect to project management tools via issue numbers
