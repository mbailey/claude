# Claude Toolkit

This is my personal toolkit for working with Claude.

## Tools

- **[claude-sandbox](#claude-sandbox)**: Runs Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` safely in isolation
- **[voice-mcp](#voice-mcp)**: Voice control integration for Claude

## claude-sandbox

claude-sandbox provides a secure way to run Claude with elevated permissions by isolating the execution environment, allowing safe use of the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag without compromising system security.

## voice-mcp

voice-mcp provides voice control capabilities for Claude, allowing hands-free interaction through speech recognition and synthesis.
